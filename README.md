#Ace's Algorithms
---

This is a repository for algorithms I've picked up while learning about the subject via textbooks, MOOCs and any other information source I come across. Although the first language I've become "fluent" in is Python, I will be adding algorithm implementations from other languages as I go along.

As of 6/21/2014, this repository also includes answers to Project Euler problems.

Current languages in repo:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Java
4. C++
5. Ruby
6. Rust
